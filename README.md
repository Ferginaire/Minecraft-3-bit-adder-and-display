# Minecraft-3-bit-adder-and-display
This is a save file of a creative world where I made a 3 bit adder with a display. You'll need to have version 1.16.3 to gaurantee that it works correctly.
There is a lot of random stuff around as I was experimenting with how it'd all work.

To find the adder and display, make your way to the coordinates 20, 56, -90. On the left you should see a giant stacked structure with a 2 digit number display at the bottom.
On the right you should see an input and another output panel in binary. On the left of the panel, input the two number in binary that you want to be added.
The result should show after a few seconds on the right of the panel in binary and also on the display panel as a base 10 number.

Each layer of the structure codes for the state of each segment of on the display.
